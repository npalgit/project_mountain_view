distinctSubsequence.py:12:REDO: and similar ones
editDistance.py:12:REDO
lis.py:13:#REDO: binary search algorithm
maximalRectangle.py:14:REDO: know how to do maxHistogram first. Then just read over the solution. no need to code everything.
regxMatching.py:21:REDO- dp is a little bit complicated with details, this is really a difficult one
shortestPalinPartition.py:10:REDO: review both solutions, optionally coding them.
wildCardMatching.py:5:REDO: quick for practice. notice the special case invovles preprocessing.
