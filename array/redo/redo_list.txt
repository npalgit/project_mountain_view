addBin.py:15:REDO: do it recursively
bestTimeToBuySellStock.py:16:REDDO: didn't figure out the trick right away. should do this very fast
bestTimeToBuySellStockMultiple.py:12:REDDO: figure out the rule fast
firstMissingPos.py:11:REDO: need to figure out the trick first try. the corner cases on annoying.
fourSums.py:16:REDO. even tho got this on the first try, after doing 3Sum, avoid duplicates annoying
gasStation.py:12:REDO: need to find the pattern. I don't like this question that much. need to solve with no hints
jumpGame.py:12:REDO: maybe not top priority, its like the max subarray problem. Do it without looking at the solution.
longestNonRepeatingSubstring.py:15:REDO for better practice.
majorityElements.py:9:REDO: moore's majority algo
maxProductSubArray.py:9:REDO
medianTwoSortedArray.py:18:REDO this problem
minSubarraySum.py:14:REDO: optional, look up O(nlog(n)) solution.
minWindowSubstr.py:18:REDO: must get slide window first try
nextPerm.py:78:REDO: smart algo
removeDuplicatesTwo.py:12:REDO: same principle applies to remove 3 or 4
removeElement.py:13:REDO: do it fast in the most efficient solution. And fix removeElement2
rotateArr.py:11:REDO: the method with mod.
slidingMaxWin.py:21:REDO: good use of deque
sortColors.py:11:REDO: many different algorithms. a few more than these. Do this without looking at sol. also dutch national flag. Four way partition?
threeSums.py:16:REDO defintily
threeSumsClosest.py:10:REDO, and also all the sums. And various solutions.
