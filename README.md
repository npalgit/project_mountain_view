#Notes on dataStructure
It contains various dataStructure I implemented both for exercise purpose and dependency by other code--those dataStructures may be used by other coding interview questions in this repo.
## To Compile a file that depends on a class from dataStructure subdirectory: 
    - Make sure the class contains package.interview.subdirectory; 
    - Go outside of root interview directory and compile.
    - javac interview/subdirectory/Class.java
    - java interview/subdirectory/Class
