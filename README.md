# Interview Questions and Solutions
200 plus leetcode problems and solutions and other problems I encountered for interview purposes. Most of the problems are implemented in Python some in Java.

**Moral of the story:** if you do 200+ leetcode problems, learn them well, and make sure the solution are optimized. You have a good chance getting into Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or Amazon.

Thats why I call this repo: project\_mountain\_view, project for getting to work in Mountain View, California, where Google's HQ is. But honestly you are better off working for those companies away from Silicon Valley.

# Notes on dataStructure
It contains various dataStructure I implemented both for exercise purpose and dependency by other code--those dataStructures may be used by other coding interview questions in this repo.
## To Compile a file that depends on a class from dataStructure subdirectory: 
    - Make sure the class contains package.interview.subdirectory; 
    - Go outside of root interview directory and compile.
    - javac interview/subdirectory/Class.java
    - java interview/subdirectory/Class
